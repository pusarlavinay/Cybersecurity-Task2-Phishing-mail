📄 Phishing Email Analysis Report
📧 Email Subject
Urgent: Your Account Has Been Suspended

📬 Sender Email
support@paypail.com

Why it’s suspicious:

The domain paypail.com is a misspelled version of the real domain paypal.com (extra “i”).

This is a classic typo-squatting technique used to fool users who aren’t paying close attention.

Legitimate emails from PayPal come from domains like @paypal.com only.

🚩 Red Flags Detected
Spoofed or fake domain name — paypail.com is not an official PayPal domain.

Urgency and threat-based language — uses fear to push action:
"Your account will be suspended unless verified within 24 hours."

Suspicious/mismatched link — link text may look like a PayPal login, but hovers to a malicious site.

e.g., http://paypal-login-authentication.com/login

Generic greeting — “Dear Customer” instead of your actual name.

Spelling and grammar issues — poor formatting and odd sentence structures.

Fake security alert — pretending to be about account safety to increase panic.

No digital signature or DKIM verification — lacks authentication.

🔗 Fake / Mismatched Links
Visible Link Text: Click here to verify your account

Actual Link (on hover): http://paypal-login-authentication.com/login

This link is not owned by PayPal and redirects users to a fake login page.
